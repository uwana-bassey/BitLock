;; Title: BitLock Protocol
;;
;; Summary:
;; Transform idle Bitcoin into productive capital through trustless collateralization.
;; Access stablecoin liquidity while preserving Bitcoin holdings and price exposure.
;;
;; Description:
;; BitLock brings institutional-grade collateralized lending to Bitcoin via Stacks.
;; Lock BTC, mint stablecoins against your position, and keep full control of your
;; assets. Algorithmic risk management ensures protocol safety through automated
;; health monitoring and smart liquidation triggers.
